# ⚓ TITANIC - ML From Disaster ⚓

Link To The Kaggle Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data"> Titanic Dataset </a>


# 1️⃣ Overview

The data has been split into two groups:

<br> 
training set (train.csv)<br> 

test set (test.csv)<br> 
<br> 
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.


# 2️⃣ The Task

The goal is to create a predictive model that accurately determines whether a given passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on these attributes.
